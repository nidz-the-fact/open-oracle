# Introduction

**Open Oracle (API) - Connect Data API on Chain**

An open source, permissionless, flexible and robust framework for bringing On-demand Web2 Data to Web3.

Open Oracle is a framework that allows developers to request any API from web2, directly onchain for their web3 apps. This tool enables real-time data requests, any API and data to be used, and can be used on any EVM network. Open Oracle has been designed to make it easier for developers to build decentralized applications that can interact with the real world, thereby bridging the gap between web2 and web3.

An open source, permissionless, flexible and robust framework for independant Oracle deployment with high scale batching, revenue earning, crosschain data and instant deployment, We have developed the OpenOracleFramework for high scale and flexible oracles deployable on any EVM We are the only protocol that allows anyone to run their own fully independant.

### TLDR
- On-chain data storage made simple and secure.
- Reduces complexity while being safe and easy to understand.
- Scalable for further development and practical applications.

### Features
1. API on Chain
This is the cornerstone feature. Open Oracle is designed to allow projects, users, and service providers to create API data feeds, Web2 integrations, and new Oracles for Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and other networks effortlessly. It facilitates dynamic and open access to off-chain data, enabling SmartContract (.sol) to retrieve dynamic data for development.

2. [Data feed Price](/docs/smartcontract/openoracle)
Real-time pricing for cryptocurrencies, stocks, gold, and other assets. Prices are fetched from reliable providers and transmitted on-chain with rapid scalability.

2. Data to Crosschain
Extends cross-chain functionality, enabling DApps to collaborate and achieve composability across multiple networks seamlessly.

### Design
Open Oracle (OO) - Capability to integrate any API with a robust parsing mechanism. <br/>
Open Oracle Framework (OOF) - Real-time access to any API endpoint for various data needs. <br/>
Open Oracle Crosschain Lookup (OOCL) - On-demand cross-chain data retrieval for EVM-compatible contracts.
