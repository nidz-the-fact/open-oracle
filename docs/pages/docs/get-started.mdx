# Get Started
Easily integrate **Open Oracle**'s dynamic pricing functions into your smart contract in just a few steps. This guide reduces complexity while ensuring safety and scalability for future development and practical applications.

## OpenOracle (OO) - Guide

### `getPrice` - function
The `getPrice` function is designed to dynamically retrieve the latest price from a price oracle for a given feed ID, using the [OpenOracle (OO) Address and Feed ID](/docs/address-feedid). Below is a detailed guide on its implementation and usage.

#### Purpose
`getPrice` function ensures that a valid price is fetched from the feed, checking that the price data is recent **(Not been outdated for more than 5 minutes. If the data is outdated, the function will not work. Please contact the administrator to resolve the issue)**. It is intended for use in smart contracts that require accurate and up-to-date price data.

#### Detail
Check out the [OpenOracle (OO)](/docs/smartcontract/openoracle) repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/nidz-the-fact/open-oracle) for further information.

```solidity 
    /**
    * @dev getPrice Usecase: function is put the contract to pull dynamic prices.
    *
    * example: v.beta
    * // 1. import
    * interface OpenOracle {
            function getPrice(uint256 feedID) external view returns (uint256);
        }
    *
    * // 2. variable
    *   OpenOracle public openoracle;
    * 
    * // 3. constructor
    *   openoracle = OpenOracle(OO_ADDRESS); // edit: OO_ADDRESS
    *
    * // 4. Use (build in your function (payable))
    *   uint256 price = openoracle.getPrice(FEED_ID); // edit: REQUIRED_FEED_ID
    *   require(msg.value >= price, "Insufficient payment");
    *
    * **Note: This v.beta should not be embedded in a long-term function. 
        + And the function of updating the OO_ADDRESS, FEED_ID should also be added.**
    * 
    * @param feedID the ID of the feed to fetch the value
    * @return the latest price value of the feed
    */
    function getPrice(uint256 feedID) external view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 currentTime = block.timestamp;
        uint256 latestUpdateTime = feedList[feedID].latestPriceUpdate;
        // recheck latestPrice & Node! (No more than 5 minutes)
        require(currentTime - latestUpdateTime <= 300, "Price not available: Feed is outdated & No feed submitted yet");
    
        uint256 returnPrice;
        returnPrice = feedList[feedID].latestPrice;

        return returnPrice;
    }
```

##### Usage
How to integrate OpenOracle (OO) into your contracts to get dynamic pricing in 1-4 easy steps. <br/>
###### 1. import <br/>
```solidity
interface OpenOracle {
    function getPrice(uint256 feedID) external view returns (uint256);
}
```
###### 2. variable <br/>
```solidity
OpenOracle public openoracle;
```
###### 3. constructor <br/>
```solidity
openoracle = OpenOracle(OO_ADDRESS); // edit: address
```
###### 4. use (build in your function (payable))
```solidity
uint256 price = openoracle.getPrice(FEED_ID); // edit: number
require(msg.value >= price, "Insufficient funds");
```

*Check out the OpenOracle (OO) for [NFT](/docs/smartcontract/examples/nft), [Token](/docs/smartcontract/examples/token) examples on [GitHub](https://github.com/nidz-the-fact/open-oracle) for more information.*

##### Note
This beta version is not recommended for integration into long-term functions. Additionally consider implementing functionality to update the `OO_ADDRESS` and `FEED_ID` as needed. ([OpenOracle (OO) Address and Feed ID](/docs/address-feedid))
